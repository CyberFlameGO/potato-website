# POTATO changelog

I'll try my best to keep a changelog here for POTATO.

## 23/10/2021

POTATO's second full rewrite is now complete. All of POTATO's commands are now only avalible via Discord's slash commands. This means that POTATO will not stop working in the future.

POTATO is back! I just deployed the first build of POTATO. Currenty it only has jokes and a couple of debug features.
[Click here](/links/add) to add POTATO to your Discord server, and use the `p/help` command to see what's avalible.

I also made this website.
