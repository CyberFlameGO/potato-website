# Getting started with POTATO

## Adding POTATO to a server

To add POTATO to a Discord server, visit this link and follow the on screen guides: [https://potato.edaz.codes/add](/add)

## Configuring POTATO

POTATO has several customizable features:

- [The prefix placed before commands](#changing-the-prefix)
- [The language used in command responses]()

### Commands

POTATO's commands can be activated in 3 different ways:

- Through Discord's built-in slash commands system (Not all commands are available as slash commands).
- By mentioning POTATO. E.g. `@POTATO ping`.
- By using the command prefix. E.g. `p/ping`.

The only one of these that can be changed is the command prefix.
The command prefix's default setting is `p/`, and you can check what it is currently set to by sending `@POTATO` with no other text.

### Viewing a list of commands

If you want view a list of commands, or see detailed information about one, the `help` command is what you need!

To see all of the commands that POTATO has, use `p/help`.
To see the description, usage, and required permissions for a command, use `p/help <command>`.

```
E.g.

p/help
p/help ping
p/help help
p/help ban
```

#### Changing the command prefix

To change the command prefix, a server admin (Someone who has the `Manage Server` permission) should use the `prefix` command like so:

```
p/prefix <new prefix here>

E.g.

p/prefix $$

$$ping
```

If your server already has a custom command prefix, you should use that instead of `p/`.

### Languages

POTATO supports several languages:

- `en-GB` - British (propper) english

  Translations may not always be up to date with POTATO, and some strings may be
  missing in which case POTATO will fall back to `en-GB`.
</Callout>

The heirarchy used for language selction is as follows: Server preferred language > User preferred language > Default language.

#### Changing the language

To change your personal language preference, run the following command in a direct message with POTATO.
To change a server's language preference, a server admin (Someone who has the `Manage Server` permission) should run the following command in a text channel in the server who's language preference they wish to change.

```
To set a language preference:
p/language <language code here>

e.g.
p/language en-US

To reset a language preference to the default language (en-GB):
p/language reset
```
