# Privacy policy for POTATO

POTATO's servers may cache information such as messages, usernames, profile pictures, etc. This is to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.

If the automoderation and/or anti-raid systems are enabled for a guild by a guild adminstrator, all messages sent in that will be logged on POTATO's servers. The logged messages are stored for 30 days at the most (they'll often be deleted sooner to save disk space), and a guild administrator disabling both the automoderation and anti-raid systems will remove all the stored messages from POTATO's servers.
These messages are logged to enable the auomoderation and anti-raid system functionality.
