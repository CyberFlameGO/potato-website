# Privacy policy for POTATO

No such thing as privacy, but I only store data that you (or your Discord Guild admin) sends me.
For example, when you choose a custom prefix for a server I will store the selected prefix and the server id associated with it.

I also cache things like usernamnes and profile images to provide faster access to them. This data is wiped periodicly and is never stored for an extended period of time.

In the future I may add some opt-in features (things that server admins need to explicitly enable) that store and perform analasys on to help prevent hate speech and flag potentially dangerous users, but these will be disabled by default and require server admins to opt in.

If you want to have your data deleted for any reason, just flick an email to edazpotato@gmail.com and I'll see what I can do. You'll need to be able to prove that you own the data or have permission from the owner to request deletion of their data on their behalf.
