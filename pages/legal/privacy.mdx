POTATO's servers may cache information such as messages, usernames, profile
pictures, etc. This is to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage. These
are cleared regularaly.

If the automoderation and/or anti-raid systems are enabled for a guild by a
guild adminstrator, all messages sent in that will be parsed by POTATO's servers
(but not stored). These messages are parsed to enable the auomoderation and
anti-raid system functionality.

You may request deletion of all of the data that POTATO has stored about you by
running the `/deletemydata` command in a direct message with the POTATO Dsicord
bot. Guild adminstrators can request deletion of all the data that POTATO has
stored about a guild by running the `/deletemydata` command in a guild text
channel.
