# Terms of service for POTATO

These terms can change at any time without notice and changes come into effect immediately.
In this document "POTATO", and "the bot" refer to the POTATO Discord bot and it's connected systems such as POTATO's web dashboard, and "I", and "me" refer to Edazpotato, the developer of the POTATO Discord bot.

I reserve the right to disable a person's access to POTATO at any time, without warning, and without proving any reasoning if I so choose to.

POTATO is free, open source software, that I run out of generosity, and does not come with any kind of support garuntee or waranty.

I don't live in America so you can't sue me.
